# ***Enterprise RAG Support Platform***

A production-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation platform for enterprise IT support automation. The system retrieves relevant knowledge-base content, generates source-backed support answers, classifies user issues, predicts ticket priority, recommends the correct support team, and logs query activity for observability.

## Project Overview

This project simulates an enterprise IT service desk assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Instead of answering only from general model knowledge, the assistant searches a local knowledge base, retrieves relevant document chunks, and generates grounded support responses with source references.

The platform is designed to demonstrate backend engineering, semantic search, vector databases, API design, ticket automation, routing logic, evaluation, and observability.

## Key Features

* Synthetic enterprise IT knowledge-base documents
* Document ingestion from Markdown files
* Text chunking with metadata
* Embedding generation using SentenceTransformers
* Vector storage using ChromaDB
* Semantic retrieval over knowledge-base chunks
* RAG-style answer generation with source references
* Ticket classification
* Priority prediction
* Support team routing
* FastAPI backend
* Streamlit web interface
* Query logging using JSONL logs
* Swagger API documentation
* Planned evaluation pipeline for retrieval and routing quality

How It Works

1. Document Ingestion

The ingestion script reads Markdown files from the data/ folder.

Markdown files → text extraction → chunks → metadata

Run:

python src/ingest.py

This creates embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB.

2. Semantic Retrieval

The retriever converts a user question into an embedding and searches ChromaDB for the most relevant document chunks.

Example:

Question:
My VPN is not working after I reset my password
Retrieved sources:
- vpn_troubleshooting_kb.md
- password_reset_kb.md

Run:

python src/retriever.py

3. Answer Generation

The generator uses retrieved context and returns a support answer with source references.

Run:

python src/generator.py

4. Ticket Classification and Routing

The classifier predicts:

* Ticket summary
* Category
* Priority
* Assigned support team

Example output:

{
  "summary": "My VPN is not working after I reset my password",
  "category": "VPN Connectivity",
  "priority": "Medium",
  "assigned_team": "Network Support"
}

Run:

python src/ticket_classifier.py

5. FastAPI Backend

Start the API server:

uvicorn src.api:app --reload

Open Swagger docs:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Available endpoints:

GET  /
GET  /health
POST /ask
GET  /logs

Example /ask request:

{
  "question": "My VPN is not working after I reset my password"
}

Example response:

{
  "question": "My VPN is not working after I reset my password",
  "answer": "Based on the knowledge base...",
  "sources": [
    "vpn_troubleshooting_kb.md",
    "password_reset_kb.md"
  ],
  "ticket": {
    "summary": "My VPN is not working after I reset my password",
    "category": "VPN Connectivity",
    "priority": "Medium",
    "assigned_team": "Network Support"
  },
  "fallback_triggered": false,
  "latency_ms": 1749.13
}

6. Streamlit UI

Start FastAPI first:

uvicorn src.api:app --reload

Then open a second terminal and run:

streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

The UI allows users to enter support questions and view:

* Generated answer
* Source documents
* Ticket category
* Priority
* Assigned team
* Latency
* Fallback status

7. Query Logging

Every API query is logged to:

logs/query_logs.jsonl

Each log stores:

* Timestamp
* Question
* Answer
* Sources
* Ticket recommendation
* Fallback status
* Latency

Example log entry:

{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-15T17:51:07.894699Z",
  "question": "My VPN is not working after I reset my password",
  "sources": ["vpn_troubleshooting_kb.md", "password_reset_kb.md"],
  "ticket": {
    "category": "VPN Connectivity",
    "priority": "Medium",
    "assigned_team": "Network Support"
  },
  "fallback_triggered": false,
  "latency_ms": 1749.13
}
